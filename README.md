Personal Python Project to Learn and Demonstrate New Skills

Voltron is a password strength checker that:
- takes input
- doesn't save it or record it anywhere
- provides feedback on how strong the password is
- educates users on password health

Future features...?
- graphical display (on a webpage maybe?) of how strong the password is
- displays relevant tips/links
- GIF demo?

Really though, use MFA and/or passkeys!
