# voltron
This is a personal Python project to learn about password security, unit testing, and demonstrate skills.

Voltron is a password strength checker that:
- takes input
- doesn't save it or record it anywhere
- provides feedback on how strong the password is
- educates users on password health

Really though, use MFA and/or passkeys! ðŸ™ƒ
