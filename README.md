Personal Python Project to Learn and Demonstrate New Skills


20250204 - Initial commit, brainstorming project ideas.  Stay tuned.


Initial thoughts - this will be a password strength checker
- takes input
- doesn't save it it record it anywhere (yikes)
- graphical display (on a webpage maybe?) of how strong the password is
- displays relevant tips/links
- GIF demo?
